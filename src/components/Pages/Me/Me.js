                <p>I have always been fascinated by technology. After working for several years as an IT tech/admin, I knew that I didn't just want to interact with technology; I also wanted to contribute to creating it â€” in my own small way.</p>
                <p>I fell in love with seeing the fruits of my labor come to life both on the screen and physically in front of me. I have found joy in expressing myself through code, UI/UX, interactive design, and audio/visual experiences.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I run a small boutique house music record label called Concise Music, and I enjoy anything and everything to do with motorcycling.</p>
