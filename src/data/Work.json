Derrick felt the style of the site matched exactly the aesthetic he was going for."

We started with creating a new palette that expressed movement, diversity and culture along with typefaces that better captured the organization's tone. Then, the content was completely reimagined to emphasize their three key focus areas: Immigration Services, Culture, and Community. With this refocus in place, we could showcase these areas distinctly yet cohesively with our new branding."
