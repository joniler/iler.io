Derrick's general style of clothing is very black and blue oriented, and he made it clear he wanted that reflected on his site. I created a palette of smooth, dark blues and deep grays; never going straight to black. The site is a single page design with a beautiful hero to draw you in. Derrick felt the style of the site matched exactly the aesthetic he was going for."

We started with creating a new palette that expressed movement, diversity and culture along with typefaces that better captured the organization's tone. Then, the content was completely reimagined to emphasize their three key focus areas: Immigration Services, Culture, and Community. With this refocus in place, we could showcase these areas distinctly yet cohesively with our new branding."

We chose the Panton typeface and then added the small triangle on the 'R' and customized a few of the letterforms to round out the main logo. For the website, we wanted to keep it clean and crisp with bold splashes of color. Custom icons and horizontal content bands break up the information into easy sections."
