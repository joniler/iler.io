My portfolio page built using the lovely Joshua Iz's [Plate for Gatsby](https://github.com/joshuaiz/plate-for-gatsby) starter theme and a bunch of custom JS/React stuffs.

Using WordPress as a headless CMS for blog posts and portfolio entries with React & Gatsby doing the heavy lifting on the front end.

Cheers!
